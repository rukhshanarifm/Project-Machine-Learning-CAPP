Identifyng bot tweets COVID

Given the current pandemic of COVID-19 affecting the world is crucial for the people, to get
accurate and timely information. Twitter, one of the most important social media platforms, is
working assiduous spreading reliable and trustworthy facts related to the pandemic. However,
as the pandemic is spreading, the misinformation is spreading as fast as the disease itself. Bots
